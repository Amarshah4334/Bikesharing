# Bikesharing
Using Tableau to visualize bike-sharing data
use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

# Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Add these new visualizations to the two created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

# Results:
1. Most bike users are more likely to use bikes in the first hour of rifing
2. Larger percent of bike users are males
3. Weekday bike usage is higher in men
4. Bike use by men is higher on an hourly basis than any other genders
5. Subscribers are more likely to use bikes than non subscribers
6. More than 80% are Subscribers, with an ~19% or regular non-subscribers.
7. Peak hours in August are between 5 to 7 pm


# Summary:

August 2019 showed a high usage of bike sharing service in New York city.
Higher concentration of riders who were males are predominanly in Manhattan, most during evening rush hours. 
Even though the data suggest times utilised by bike users is indicative of commute workers there is a high probability of tourists using bikes as well at the same time, this can be factored in as most of the data is focused in Manhatten.

Recommendations for future:
1. Changes to user satisfaction in app use, 
2. Commute trends across rest of the months of the year,
3. Gas prices and 
4. Climate factors need to be considered across the year. 
Can affect the bike sharing business.
